# Development History

## Architecture Evolution Overview

This document provides historical context on how the tf-splunk-aws project evolved from a consolidated single-file approach to the current modular architecture.

*Note: This is historical documentation. For current project status, see [README.md](README.md)*

## Key Evolution Points

### Previous State

- Single 1,287-line main.tf file with all infrastructure
- All resources consolidated in one place
- Difficult to maintain and test individual components

### Current State (Final Architecture)

- 4 focused modules: network, security, compute, splunk
- Clear separation of concerns and dependency management
- Maintainable, reusable, and testable infrastructure

### Major Achievement

Cost optimization from ~$97/month to ~$21.80/month (77% reduction) through architectural decisions like using NAT instances instead of NAT Gateways.

---

**Result**: Production-ready infrastructure following Terraform best practices with significant cost optimization. âœ…
