# .copilot Directory

This directory contains AI assistant context files specifically for the tf-splunk-aws project.

## File Structure

| File | Purpose | When to Consult |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `PROJECT.md` | Project scope, boundaries, and change approval workflow | Before ANY infrastructure modifications |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Current state, technical decisions, and cost constraints | When planning architectural changes |

## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Assistants (GitHub Copilot, etc.)
1. **Always read PROJECT.md first** before making infrastructure changes
2. **Consult ARCHITECTURE.md** for current state and technical context
3. **Follow the change approval workflow** defined in PROJECT.md
4. **Never exceed cost constraints** specified in these files

### For Developers
- These files provide context about project constraints and current state
- Reference when onboarding to the project
- Update when making significant architectural changes

## File Maintenance

- Update these files when project scope or architecture changes
- Keep cost estimates current
- Document new architectural decisions
- Maintain change approval workflow accuracy
